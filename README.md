# ShopIt

Simple iOS app (meant for iPhone X+) using Google Firebase that allows for maintenance of quotidian shopping lists.

## Running the App

ShopIt can be opened in Xcode and deployed to an iOS device just like an other app, but there are a few steps that need to be completed first:

• Download and install [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/)  
• From the root directory, run the following command in terminal:
`pod install`  
• Open up the .xcworkspace file, and deploy to your device!
